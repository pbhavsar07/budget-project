# budget-project
To calculate expenses for current month
// Budget-Expense Manager

App will run as by running Index.html file in the browser. no Apache server is needed for this.
 
we have used 3 modules
BudgetController, UIController and MainController.
With Respect to MVC pattern -
Here, Budget Controller acts as a model,
	  UI controller acts as View and
	  Main Controller acts as Controller that sends requests to both these controllers or Modules.
	  
App calculates the budget for Current Month, it fetches the current month and displays on the top.
All the Expenses are red marked and incomes are colored as greenish-blue.
with expenses been calculated in percentage with total income.

App Includes Modular JS and not Object Oriented Javascript here. This is my Learning project and will update 
to next level using graph and pie chart.
